# What is this?
A script so scrape image sites, like IMGUR and IMGbb.
I's not made to be user friendly, as this is mostly a quick project for myself.


## How to use  
Open app.py in a text editor 
Change "PageToScrape", and imageSavePath. 

- PageToScrape: 
  - Check siteInfo for wich to use here. 
- imageSavePath
  - The path wich the downloaded images will be saved.

## How to add own site:
You don't. 

But if you really want to, add a entry to "siteInfo".
You also need to create functions etc for every site you want to scrape.

Feel free to create a pull request if you ever add more sites :)
